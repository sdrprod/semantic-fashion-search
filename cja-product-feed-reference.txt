Product Feed API Reference
URL: https://ads.api.cj.com/query

Overview
This documentation provides technical specifications for CJ's GraphQL Product API, that enables you to access specific product information from an advertiser's product feed (catalog).

This API has 2 parts – Mutations & Query.

Product Import (Mutation)
This feature is currently allowed for Shopping and Finance feeds only. It allows Advertisers to import product feed data into CJ. Advertisers can perform mutations to create new products, modify existing products, remove products from their CJ Product Feed via the API. This is especially useful for advertisers who make frequent updates to their product catalogs in smaller volumes and can avoid sending full product feeds.

Product Search (Query)
This feature is allowed for Product feeds of all Advertiser verticals (Shopping/ Travel/ Finance). It can be used by both Advertisers & Publishers. Publishers can especially benefit by using this API endpoint to access Product Feed Summary as well as Product details. See the Code samples for separate methods for Feed Summary & Product Search.

Product Feed Summary Search (productFeeds)
This query provides a summary view of feed information consisting of advertiser adId, Feed Name, productCount, lastUpdated etc. GraphQL functionality can be utilized to get the exact set of fields you want from the API. For an Advertiser, this query feature allows you to access all your product feeds summary information. For a Publisher, it allows to access all the product feed summary information for one or more advertisers (Joined and non-joined). This is recommended when you want to search for specific feeds before searching for specific products.
Product Detail Search (products, shoppingProducts, travelExperienceProducts)
These queries allow you to access specific product information from an advertiser’s product feed. This is recommended when you want to search low volumes of products on a near real-time basis. They allow you to search for all common fields for all products including advertiser id, keywords, name, category, etc. GraphQL functionality can be utilized to get the exact set of fields you want from the API.
Product Feed (Subscription)
This feature allows publishers to query the product feed once and receive the products from that feed as a streaming HTTP response. You can only extract one Product Feed at a time.

Note: Product Feeds designated as private in the CJ Account Manager are not available through the Product Search.

Product Import
Pre-requisites:
Personal Access Token: You need to get Personal Access Token from CJ Developer Portal. If you already use a CJ personal access token for authentication, a new token need not be created.
CompanyId: You need CJ generated CompanyId. This will ensure you have the permission to query on behalf of that company.
FAQs
I have never sent a shopping feed file to CJ. Can I use the API to start sending the product feed for the first time?
Yes. If you have not registered a shopping feed before, then you need to register a new feed with an API delivery option and use the newly created Ad Id in the API. To register a new feed go to Campaigns> Ad Assets> Product Feeds in CJ Account Manager.
Is it mandatory to switch to this API from product feed files?
No. CJ Product Import API provides a faster & modernized way to send product feed data and it is optional for advertisers to utilize this benefit to send product feeds.
What do I need to start using the API to send products?
Personal Access Token and Ad ID
Should I register a new feed to use the API?
If you have been previously sending in a file and want to either switch to the API or use both file and API, then you don't need to register a new feed to use the API. You can use the existing Ad ID of the CJ Shopping Feed.
Where can I see my existing feed Ad ID?
CJ Account Campaigns> Ad Assets> Product Feeds
Will my Shopping Product API updates be visible in my product feed within CJ Account Manager?
Updates to your Shopping Products will be visible in CJ Account Manager under Campaigns > Ad Assets >Products within few seconds after you receive a successful API response.
Will my Finance Product API updates be visible in my product feed within CJ Account Manager?
The information on your Finance Product Feeds will not be visible in the CJ Account Manager.
When should I use Product feed file versus Product Import via API?
APIs and Product feed files are both effective ways to send the product data to CJ depending on your product feed volume.
If you have a low volume product feed, you can use the API for the first time import as well as subsequent imports with delta.
If you have a high-volume product feed updated frequently, we recommend you import the full product file first time through batch. Subsequent updates for the feed can be sent only via API.
Will my publishers be able to see the newly added products or updates to existing products?
Today, CJ Publishers can view the product feed information through multiple channels. Changes made to a Product Feed are visible on the CJ Account Manager , CJ Product Search API as well as Publisher Product Export feeds.
Can I use the API for building custom applications?
Yes, integrating systems across businesses is a key benefit of any API. You can use the API to integrate with your internal product systems and automate the feed transfer process.
What happens if I use both Batch files and APIs?
We do not recommend using both the methods simultaneously as it may overwrite the feed data.
How many products can I send in one API request?
Please refer to section - Mutation Usage Caps/Limits to get the fastest API response.

Mutation usage caps/limits
Limit the request to max 1,000 products in 1 request to get a good response time of 1-2 seconds.
Any volume of data higher than 1,000 should be broken down in chunks of 1000 products as multiple API requests to get a timely response
Call limit: 500 calls per 5 minutes.
Errors
Authentication/Authorization Errors
Please make sure you are including your valid Personal Access Token.
Please make sure you provide the correct CJ Shopping feed AID as an argument in the API request. We use this ad id to verify that the personal access token belongs to a user on the advertiser account and that you are authorized to make updates to the ad id/feed.
Query Parsing Errors
Feel free to use the GraphiQL App to test out your queries.
Just go to https://ads.api.cj.com/ in your browser. Don't forget your Personal Access Token in the top left corner.
Product Search
Pre-requisites
Personal Access Token: You need to get Personal Access Token from CJ Developer Portal. If you already use a CJ personal access token for authentication, a new token need not be created.
companyId: You need CJ generated CompanyId. This will ensure you have the permission to query on behalf of that company.
partnerIds: As a publisher you need CJ generated CompanyId of the advertiser whose feeds you are interested in. You can specify multiple advertiser company Ids. If you do not specify then all the feeds of all the advertisers is fetched. For an advertiser, this argument is ignored.

Pre-requisites
Personal Access Token: You need to get Personal Access Token from CJ Developer Portal. If you already use a CJ personal access token for authentication, a new token need not be created.

    shoppingProductCatalog(companyId: 999, adId: 12345678) {
        id
        adId
        description

  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-personal-access-token>' \

Pagination
The Product Details Search API supports pagination and has the following behavior:

Default Record Limit: Returns up to 1,000 records.
Maximum Limit per Query: 10,000 records.
To retrieve more than 10,000 records, use Next Page or Subscription Query (see below).
Pagination for ≤10,000 Records
To paginate in chunks (e.g., 50 records at a time), use the offset and limit parameters:

Example:

{
  "offset": 1,
  "limit": 50
}
The next page:

{
  "offset": 51,
  "limit": 50
}
Repeat this by incrementing offset by the limit until all records are retrieved.

Response Fields to Check:
totalCount: Total number of records matching the query.
limit: Number of records requested.
count: Number of records returned in the current page.
Pagination for >10,000 Records
Option 1: Products Search API
To fetch more than 10,000 results, the offset parameter is not used. Instead, use the page and limit parameters:

Step 1: First request (up to 10,000 records):

{
  "limit": 10000
}
Step 2: Next request (get the next 10,000 using page from the previous response):

{
  "limit": 10000,
  "page": "<nextPageTokenFromPreviousResponse>"
}
offset should not be specified in this mode.
Repeat using the page token provided in each response to continue paginating.
Option 2: Subscription Query (Full Product Feed)
If you want to retrieve all records from an advertiser without paging through the API manually:

Use the Subscription Query to request the full product feed directly.
Search Query usage caps/limits
Call limit: 500 calls per 5 minutes

Scalars
Name	Description
Boolean	
The Boolean scalar type represents true or false.

DecimalNumber	
A numerical value, rendered in JSON as a string.

This allows for a greater range of expression than GraphQL's default Float type supports.

For reliable client-side parsing, the string value will always match the regex pattern (-)?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?.

Float	
The Float scalar type represents signed double-precision fractional values as specified by IEEE 754.

ID	
The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as "4") or integer (such as 4) input value will be accepted as an ID.

Instant	
An ISO 8601 datetime, rendered in JSON as a string.

Int	
The Int scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.

String	
The String scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.
